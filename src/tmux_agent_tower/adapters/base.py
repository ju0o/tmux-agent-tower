"""Base adapter contract and shared, generic detection helpers.

Adapters give *opinions*, not final answers. Each adapter looks at a pane's
title/command/captured content and returns a status hint (or ``None`` when it
has no opinion). The status engine (see ``detection/status.py``) combines
that hint with generic signals such as output-hash change detection and
applies hysteresis. This keeps agent-specific pattern matching isolated so a
single wrong regex cannot silently corrupt every other agent's status.
